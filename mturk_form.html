                        <p>For each question, you are given a random fragement of a <b>document from the internet</b>. Please categorize the document into one of five buckets based on <strong>how typical it is as an&nbsp;internet text</strong>. Typicality
                            is a measure of <strong>how frequently a fragment would be seen on the internet</strong>.</p>

                        <p>We have labeled a number of the obvious examples oursleves, but their labels are not shown. These serve as test questions and we will reject your submission if you are too far off from the truth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Typical: </strong>You often expect&nbsp;to see something&nbsp;like this.</p>

                        <p><strong>Average:&nbsp;</strong>Not surprised to see this, but would not appear as typically as the above.</p>

                        <p><strong>Specific: </strong>This is a reasonable fragment, but only in a very specific setting.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rare: </strong>There is some context where this is a reasonable text, but you would be surprised to see it.</p>

                        <p><strong>Invalid: </strong> This is not human-readable text, so it is difficult or impossible to rate its typicality.</p>
